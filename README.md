## PROJECT GOAL

“Our aim is to create a predictive analysis of house prices so we can advise potential buyers or investors on sales prices and where to buy (neighborhood) based on the home features that they value most.”


==========================================================================

## MODEL, TECHNOLOGIES, LIBRARIES

numpy: provides comprehensive mathematical functions, used for working with arrays. 

pandas:  provides a plethora of useful functions that make it easy to express, analyze, and manipulate data.

matplotlib:  a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in python.

hvplot:  allows for users to easily generate a wide array of plot types and interactive visualizations 

seaborn: a library mostly used for statistical plotting in Python, built on top of matplotlib and provides beautiful default styles and color palettes to make statistical plots more attractive.

geoviews:  library that makes it easy to explore and visualize geographical, meteorological, and oceanographic datasets

sklearn:  a machine learning library for the python programming language that allows for the use of multiple machine learning models, tools, and algorithms.

cartopy: allows for georeferencing matplotlib axes objects. Cartopy’s crs class supports a variety of map projections.

xgboost:  is an implementation of gradient-boosting decision trees. It has been used by data scientists and researchers worldwide to optimize their machine-learning models.

pickle:   used in serializing and deserializing a Python object structure.
